# Cypress Automation Framework

In this project, I would like to share test automation framework that I have developed during comprehensive Cypress course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) platform using JavaScript language. Link to the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/cypress-io-master-class/). The course consists of over 35 hours of video materials and includes the basics as well as advanced topics such as handling web elements, assertions, hooks, custom commands, page object modelling, reporting, API & XHR testing, Jenkins configuration, Cucumber BDD, and more.
